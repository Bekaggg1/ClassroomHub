# ClassroomHub (Local Only)
A web platform for students to share and access useful study materials ‚Äî all in one place.
üìö Description
ClassroomHub is designed as a simple, local-only tool to help you organize and access educational files. It allows you to upload and manage different types of study materials like notes, documents, homework, and more, keeping them accessible directly in your browser.

üöÄ Features
*   **Easy Uploads:** Add files into specific categories (Materials, Documents, Homework, Notebooks).
*   **Organized Lists:** View your uploaded files neatly listed under each category.
*   **Quick Access:** Open or download your files with a single click.
*   **Simple Deletion:** Easily remove files you no longer need.
*   **Keeps Your Files:** Your uploaded files stay saved in your browser's local storage, even after closing the tab (they don't get sent online).
*   **Looks Good Anywhere:** The layout adjusts automatically to fit screens of any size, from phones to desktops (responsive design).
*   **Clean Interface:** Simple and intuitive design for easy navigation.

 üõ† Technologies Used
*   **HTML:** For structuring the content and organizing the different sections.
*   **CSS:** For styling the application, creating the visual theme, and handling responsiveness (mobile-first approach and breakpoints).
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For handling file uploads, saving/loading data from local storage, dynamically updating the page, and managing user interactions like deleting files.

 üìÇ How to Run
This project runs directly in your web browser and doesn't require any complex setup or server.

1.  **Get the code:** Download or clone the project files to your computer.
2.  **Open the file:** Navigate to the project folder and double-click `index.html`. It will open in your default web browser.
3.  **Start organizing:** Use the tabs to switch between categories and the "Choose file" button to upload your materials.

üìù Notes on Rubric Criteria:

*   **Problem Relevance & Clarity:** Addresses the common student need for organizing study materials.
*   **Functional Completeness:** Core features (upload, list, open/download, delete) are implemented.
*   **HTML Structure:** Uses semantic HTML, labels, and aria-labels for accessibility.
*   **CSS Design & Responsiveness:** Cohesive theme, mobile-first, responsive breakpoints included.
*   **JavaScript Quality:** Modular code, modern ES6+ features, basic error handling for file reading.
*   **User Experience / UI:** Intuitive navigation with tabs, minimal clicks for main actions.
*   **Documentation & Git Workflow:** This README serves as documentation. (Mention your Git practices if they involved meaningful commits).
*   **Testing & Robustness:** Includes checks for duplicate filenames and handles the empty state. Basic browser validation for file input is utilized.

‚ú® Bonus Points Considerations:
*   Database Integration: Not implemented (uses local storage).
*   Deployment: Not deployed to a public URL.

üß† Lessons Learned
While working on this final project, I learned a lot from building fully functional websites to improving my programming skills. 
It was a fascinating experience that challenged me to think creatively and code more efficiently. 
I‚Äôm truly grateful to my teacher for giving me this valuable opportunity to grow and develop.
